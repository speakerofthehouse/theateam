Title: Shuffle+

Description: 
  We are attempting to build/create a better music suffling algorithm, potentially if we have time at the end of the semester we would combine this with spotify and spotify features. Among these general improvements we want to make the shuffle more customizable by many or any topic you can rank music through. The main customizable feature would be to use some kind of ranking system to impact the shuffle.

Vision Statement:
  Your music however you want it.
  
Motivation:
  Our motivation is disatisfaction with some current shuffle algorithms and a desire to have more control over a music shuffle
  
Risks: 
  1. We have to learn new languages like html
  2. The randomization element could provide alot of difficulty to the program working as we desire
  3. Combining our design with spotify could provide difficulty

Mitigation Strategy:
  1. The entire group works on learning and mastering html
  2. Do research into current randomization algorithms to provide a solid base to build from
  3. Doing reasearch into the spotify API
  
Methodology:
  We plan to use the methodology that allows for regular check-ins week by week. This best fits with an iterative process because we plan on taking on a single aspect of the project at a time and work on it till it is completed. 
  
Project Tracking software:
  We plan to use Trello as our tracking software and regular uploads to the github repository
